An empty array "dp" has been created;
In the input object array where we find true has been changed to 10^9 and false has been changed to 0 and pushed into "dp" array using for loop
Using forEach loop converted 0 into a sequential order how many steps its taking to reach very next 10^9(true value).
By here our "dp" will be look like how many steps are required to go immediate avaliablity of respective place.
declaring the curr value as postive infity and checking with the maximum value(maxVal) of each index of "dp" array. 
if maxVal is less than curr value then curr value is changed to maxVal and its index is stored as idx.
else maxval is greater than curr value there will be no change in curr and idx value.
step 6 and stpe 7 is repeated till the length of "dp" array.
and the final idx is returned.
